### Property details and features: 
- Each property is presented as a card, including information such as price, number of bedrooms, square footage, and buttons to add the property to a favorite list or view the property details page.
### Enhanced User Experience: 
- The site integrates the Google Maps API, which concentrates on the area of the zip code when users click on the zip code of each property. 
- Additionally, users can view a chart that uses the ChartJS library to show livability grades and things to consider when moving to the state by clicking on the state abbreviation of each property card.
